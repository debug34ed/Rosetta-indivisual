## Overview

By using Rosetta framework, users can directly perform training or inference task on all of their respective dataset without leaking any privacy to others just after adding a single code `import latticex.rosetta`  at the header of your existing TensorFlow programs (see our [tutorial documentation](TUTORIALS.md) for more details) in the simplest case. Besides, to make it flexible we also provide some easy-to-use APIs, which we will describe in the following context.

The APIs can mainly be classified into two types: 'Control API', which should be sufficient for most of your tasks, and 'Operation API', a set of TensorFlow-style Operators called `SecureOps`. The first type provides you with the ability to control the context of backend cryptographic protocols, pre-process your datasets and so on. The second type is for advanced usage, and you can use them in the same way as the native `tf.Operation`, where TensorFlow executes them with a stream of ciphertext flowing through them.. 

Moreover, since `Rosetta v1.0.0` multi-threaded execution of multiple tasks has been adopted. The main changes are in 'Control API', as each running task is bind with a secure protocol instance, `task_id` argument is added to those APIs to reference the specified task. In addition, we have carefully handled interface compatibility issues so that the code still works correctly with `Rosetta v0.2.0` and newer versions.

## Control API

### Protocol Management

#### `activate(protocol_name=None, protocol_config_str=None, task_id=None)`

  Activate the protocol for the specific task to carry out your subsequent TensorFlow Operations.

  It is highly recommended that you use this interface explicitly to choose your backend protocol before calling `run` in the TensorFlow session.
  
  > Note: DO NOT call `activate` while your program is executing TensorFlow graph.

  **Args:**

  - **`protocol_name`**: Name of the protocol, which MUST be one of the supported protocols. If this parameter is not provided, the default protocol will be used.

  - **`protocol_config_str`**: The config JSON string that is compatible with your protocol. [deprecated since `v1.0.0`]
  
  - **`task_id`**: ID of the task.


#### `deactivate(task_id=None)`

  Deactivate backend protocol for the specific task.

  All the resources related, such as the network connections and local cache, will be released.

  **Args:**
  - **`task_id`**: ID of the task. 

  > Note: DO NOT call `deactivate` while your program is executing TensorFlow graph.

#### `get_supported_protocols()`

  Get list of all the backend cryptographic protocols.

  You can activate one of the protocols as your backend Ops.

  If you are a protocol developer, you can implement and register your own protocols in the backend, and you will see and use them here just as the native ones.

  **Returns:**
    
  The list of the names of the supported secure protocols.

#### `get_default_protocol_name()`

  Get the name of the default protocol that will be used if none is set.


#### `get_protocol_name(task_id=None)`

  Get the protocol name for the specific task.

#### `get_party_id(task_id=None)`

  Get your party id of for specific task (0, 1, 2 for party `P0`, `P1`, `P2` respectively).

  **Args:**

  - **`task_id`**: ID of the task.


### Input and Dataset Utils

#### `private_input(node_id: str, input_value: list, task_id=None)`

  One party set its private input value to be shared among multi-parties.

  **Args:**

  - **`node_id`**: Node ID, Indicates which node's `input_value` will be shared.
  
  - **`input_value`**: Local input values. ONLY the inputs of the node that has the same node id as the `node_id` will be processed.
  
  - **`task_id`**: ID of the task. 

  **Returns:**
    
  The local shared part, ciphertext, of the real value. Note that each party will has different cipher value that returned.


#### `private_console_input(node_id: str, task_id=None)`

  Just the same as private_input while the values will be fetched from console.

  **Args:**

  - **`node_id`**: Node ID, indicates which node's `input_value` will be shared.
  
  - **`task_id`**: ID of the task. 

  **Returns:**

  The local shared part, ciphertext, of the real value. Note that each party will has different cipher value that returned.

#### `class PrivateDataSet`

  A wrapper class for multiparty to align and 'encrypt' or 'share' its private dataset from a local CSV file or `ndarray` target of numpy. 
  
  Every party's dataset should be either sample-aligned or feature-aligned already.

  When instantiation, for example, if dataset_type == DatasetType.SampleAligned (default dataset_type is SampleAligned),
  assuming node `P0`, node `P1` owns private data, `P1` owns label, then all the parties do respectively:
  ```python
  # get private data from its own data source, set None if no private data
  XX, YY = ...
  X, Y = PrivateDataset(data_owner=("P0","P1"), label_owner=1).load_data(XX, YY)
  ```
  Otherwise, if dataset_type == DatasetType.FeatureAligned, label_owner is useless.
  For example, assuming `P0`, `P1` owns private data and label, then all the parties do respectively:
  ```python
  # get private data from its own data source, set None if no private data
  XX, YY = ... 
  X,y = PrivateDataset(data_owner=("P0","P1"),
                      dataset_type=DatasetType.FeatureAligned).load_data(XX, YY)
  ```
  - **load_X(self, x: str or np.ndarray or None, task_id : str="", \*args, \*\*kwargs)**
    
    Load and 'secret-shared' private ATTRIBUTE values from local dataset files or `ndarray` object of `numpy` for task with ID `task_id`.

    For example, if dataset shape of P0 is N * d0, dataset shape of P1 is N * d1, and P2 has no data at all.
    Then the resulting 'ciphertext' local dataset returned for each party is of the shape N * (d0 + d1).

    Return:
      The shared 'ciphertext' local dataset, and its datatype is string with format specific to your current activated protocol.

  - **load_Y(self, y: str or np.ndarray or None, task_id : str="", \*args, \*\*kwargs)**
    
    Load and 'secret-shared' private LABEL values from local dataset files or `ndarray` object of `numpy` for task with ID `task_id`.
    
    Only the input file of 'label_owner'-party will be processed.
    Return:
      The shared 'ciphertext' local label dataset, and its datatype is string with format specific to your current activated protocol.
  - **load_XY(self, X: str or np.ndarray or None, y: str or np.ndarray or None, task_id : str="", \*args, \*\*kwargs)**

    The combination of the above two functions (`load_X`, `load_Y`).

#### `class PrivateTextLineDataset`

  Private text line dataset, either for one or multiple file inputs.

  It is used in the same way as TextLineDataset, but has one more parameter `data_owner` than TextLineDataset, which represents which party holds the private data.

  For example, assuming node with ID `P0` owns private data, it instantiates like this:
  ```python
  file_x = ...
  dataset_x0 = rtt.PrivateTextLineDataset(
                    file_x, data_owner='P0')  # P0 hold the file data
  ```

  For example, assuming node with ID `P1` owns private data, it instantiates like this:
  ```python
  file_x = ...
  dataset_x1 = rtt.PrivateTextLineDataset(
                    file_x, data_owner='P1')  # P1 hold the file data
  ```

  Floating point precision for task with `task_id`.



## Operation API

The main magic component that supports these upper-level conveniences is our implementation of a new suites of privacy-preserving-enabled secure `Operation` based on TensorFlow's flexible extension mechanism for introducing new operation library. To distinguish it from the native TensorFlow API Operation (hereinafter referred to directly as `Ops`), we refer to these customized Operation as `SecureOps`.

Here we describe how to use the various `SecureOps` interfaces supported in the `Rosetta`. Most of interface signature of these `SecureOps` is consistent with the corresponding `Ops`' in TensorFlow, and only in a few cases have we extended the native one with more MPC-related functionality (e.g., the `SaveV2` operation, etc.).

If you need to build your own specific privacy protection model based on Rosetta's underlying API, or are interested in our extending our `SecureOps` set, this is the right place you should start with. In addition, unit tests in the source code can also help you to understand the usage of the various `SecureOps`.

### Terms and definition

We will try to represent each `SecureOp` interface in an clear and easy-to-understand way as far as we can. Occasionally, we will use some cryptographic terms for concision, which you can refer to [glossary document](GLOSSARY.md) for their definition if you are not sure.

### Common notes

1. Unlike the input and output `Tensor` of `Ops` in native TensorFlow, the parameters and return values of `SecureOps` are considered to be a **shared value** in a secret state, unless an explicit declaration is made that an input value is an explicit constant (see the related `SecureOps` interface declaration below). You may not use these 'garbled' values directly.

2. On data type (`dtype`) of  `SecureOps` input and output `Tensor`, **Rosetta's Python frontend will uniformly convert them as `tf.string' in the current version.**

3. For binary operators such as `SecureAdd`, The current `Rosetta v1.0.0` supports `Tensor`s of dimension up to 5, while for unary input operators such as `SecureRelu` the tensor shape is unrestricted (note: `Rosetta v0.2.0` does not support `Tensor`s of dimension more than 2).

### I/O SecureOps

#### `SecureSaveV2(prefix, tensor_names, shape_and_slices,tensors, name=None)`

  This is the underlying Operation to save tensors in V2 checkpoint format. In native TensorFlow, its corresponding operation, `save_v2`,  which has the identical interface signature, is also wrapped by the `tf.train.Saver()` interface, rather than being called directly.  **Unlike the native `Saver`, this `SecureOp` can save the plaintext tensors in files only in specific parties by configuration.** In Rosetta, by default, you have no need to use this `SecureOp` neither, because our `Static Pass` functionality (see its definition in [glossary](GLOSSARY.md)) can help you perform the correct replacement intrinsically.

  The configurational option in `Rosetta v0.2.0` is the `SAVER_MODE` keyword in `CONFIG.json`.  Its  value os parsed as a 3-bit Flag for $[P2\ P1 \ P0]$, so it can be one of the following:

  - $0$: every party saved the local shared value, rather than plaintext value. **This is the default action.**
  - $1$: the saved plaintext file will be stored in party `P0`.
  - $2$: the saved plaintext file will be stored in party `P1`.
  - $3$: the saved plaintext file will be stored both in party  `P0` and` P1`.
  - $4$: the saved plaintext file will be stored in party `P2`.
  - $5$: the saved plaintext file will be stored both in party `P0` and `P2`.
  - $6$: the saved plaintext file will be stored both in party `P1` and `P2`.
  - $7$: the saved plaintext file will be stored in all parties, i.e `P0`, `P1` and `P2`. 

  **Args:**
  
  - **`prefix`**: A `Tensor` of type `string`. Must have a single element. The prefix of the V2 checkpoint to which we write the tensors.
  - **`tensor_name`**: A `Tensor` of type `string`. shape ${N}$. The names of the tensors to be saved.
  - **`shape_and_slices`**: A `Tensor` of type `string`. shape ${N}$.  The slice specs of the tensors to be saved. Empty strings indicate that they are non-partitioned tensors.
  - **`tensors`**:A list of `Tensor` objects, which are in shared status. $N$ tensors to save.
  - **`name`**: A name for the operation (optional).
  
  **Returns:**
  
  The created Operation.
  
  *NOTE*: Every party must have the same configured value so that the system call perform the correct actions. **This Configuration is important due to its output values, which may be sensitive,  are in plaintext . So be cautious and reach a consensus among all the parties.**

#### `PrivateInput(x, data_owner, name=None)`

  Define a private input，this represents a `private` input owned by the specified player into the graph.

  **Args:**
  - **`x`**: The data from data owner, supported data types: int32, int64, float, double, string.
  - **`data_owner`**: The private data owner which is data node id (string type). For compatibility with older versions(earlier than `v1.0.0`), `data_owner` = 0 means computation node party `P0` hold the data, data_owner = 1 means computation node party `P1` hold the data, data_owner = 2 means computation node party `P2` hold the data.
  - **`name`**: A name for the operation (optional).

  **Return value:**
    A `Tensor`, of type string and the same shape as `x`.

  *Note*: 
  > The load data of the return value is encrypted or shared.
